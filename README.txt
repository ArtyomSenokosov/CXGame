The AlphabetCXPlayer interface was implemented as a class representing a player for the game Connect based on the current state of the playing field.
The AlphabetCXPlayer class has various attributes and methods that help you manage the game logic and search algorithm implementation. Some of the major design decisions made include:
Using alpha-beta pruning: The search algorithm used is the alpha-beta pruning algorithm, which reduces the number of evaluated moves and optimizes the search. This approach is chosen to maximize player efficiency.
Timeout management: To prevent the player from exceeding the time limit assigned for each move, a mechanism has been implemented to control the time elapsed during the search. If the time limit is close to expiring, the player will return the best move found up to that point.
Using a token scoring cache: To avoid recalculating the score for the same playing field configuration multiple times, a map-based cache has been implemented. The cache stores the score for each playing field configuration already scored, allowing the stored score to be retrieved rather than recalculated.
Scoring based on various factors: The score for each evaluated move takes into account several factors, including the token score, defense score and position score. These factors are weighed based on the chosen game strategy and help determine the best move to make.
During implementation, some difficulties were encountered, including:
Determining the Maximum Depth Value: Choosing the maximum depth value for the search algorithm was an important design decision. Too low a value could lead to inadequate evaluation of moves, while too high a value could cause the player to be excessively slow. A balance had to be found between the accuracy of the ratings and the player's performance.
Time Limit Management: Making sure the player meets the assigned time limit was a delicate task. Careful time management was required during the search to ensure that the player returned a valid move within the given time limits.
